    "Descrption": "I am deep in gambling debt. I keep on stealing money from the old man and blaming his kids for all the missing money. But he seems found out the truths. I must kill him and again blame his kid for the killing.  I left the casino receipt in the kid's room. I went through the second door(It is left open for some reason) killed the man. I was expecting to see his wife but she was not there. It saved some troublesome. I put the dagger in my secured safe to make sure no one can find it."
