  "Descrption": "My dad blaming me of gambling again. It is ridiculous. I don't gamble. I just went the casino once with the accountant. It cost too much. I dropped it. He is blaming me on everything. I am not his son. I am just one of his belongnings. He even took my girlfriend. I wish he can die soon so that I can take control and live happy. Last night the wife is with me. Someone sent her a notes on my behalf. It is strange. So she stayed with me until down."
