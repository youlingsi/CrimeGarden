  "Descrption": "The lord is a horrible man. I worked for him for 20 years, he insults me all the time. There was multiple time I want to kill him. But I was a coward. I cannot do it. Sometimes I left the out door open, hoping some robber will come in and kill him. On the murder day, he scolded me again.  I did it again last night."
